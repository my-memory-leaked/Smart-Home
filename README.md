# Smart Home 

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Smart Home project. The project aims to create a smart home system using various mechanisms and sensors to enhance convenience and security.

## Implemented Mechanisms

The following mechanisms have been implemented in the project:

- **Free RTOS**: Real-Time Operating System used for multitasking and scheduling tasks.
- **Http ESP32 Server**: An HTTP server running on ESP32 microcontroller for communication and control.
- **Ajax Asynchronous Variables**: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax) used for handling variables asynchronously.

## Features

The Smart Home project includes the following features:

- **Closing and Opening Door**: The project enables the control of door opening and closing using a power jack. This can be achieved through a user-friendly HTTP website.
- **Animal Counting**: The system utilizes an IR sensor to count the number of animals present inside the smart home. Alternatively, a microwave sensor could have been used.
- **Temperature Sensor Readings**: The project provides temperature sensor readings for monitoring the indoor environment.
- **Improper Opening/Closing Indication**: The system includes a mechanism to indicate any improper opening or closing of doors, ensuring security.
